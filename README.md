# Fine-Tuning VGG19 using PyTorch

This repository contains the fine-tuning of the pretrained VGG-19 convolutional neural network (CNN) on the Flower Species Dataset, encompassing 15 distinct flower species. Over the course of 20 experiments, modifications will be applied to the model's hyperparameters, with a specific emphasis on observing their impact on performance.

The project was developed as part of our coursework in the Fundamentals of Machine Learning - Fall 2023.
